# **HMAC Registry**

General idea that CCHMC may not be the same as other hospitals
Ways we can be thinking about creating a registry that is also applicable to other systems

## Population Identification
  1. Aged 16 and older (based on transition ages within other hospital systems)
  2. Specific clinical encounters
   * ED visit
   * Urgent Care visit
   * Same-Day Surgery
   * Admission

## Demographics
  1. Site-Base or Liberty
  2. Admitting team
  3. Care teams throughout admission or ED visit
  4. Discharge team
  5. Outpatient provider/clinic
  6. Most recent outpatient appointment
  7. Number of outpatient appointments in 365 days prior to admission
  8. Patient residence
  9. Patient insurance
    * during encounter
    * 2 years prior

## Outcomes
  1. ICU stay
  2. LOS vs bed days
  3. Number of consults
  4. UC consult
  5. Transfer out
  6. Code status (or documented code status?)
  7. Documentation of healthcare proxy
